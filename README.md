## About me:

I am currently studying OOP programming with a focus on AI at NBI Handelsakademin. With experience in customer-facing roles, I’ve developed strong problem-solving and communication skills.

Now, I’m eager to apply my knowledge in C#, Python, and SQL to build effective solutions and grow as a programmer.
